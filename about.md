I am a *political scientist* working at the intersection of data science and social science. My research interests span both domains of data analytics and political studies, with a regional focus on East Asia. The unifying theme of my research is to use fast growing scientific methods, data-oriented research design and statistical computing to decipher and prescribe social and political problems. Areas of substantive topics include democratization, political economy, public policy and human rights. I pursue both data analytics and data modeling in building public goods, aiming at improving policies, governance and representation.
